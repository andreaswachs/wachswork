title = "About me"
+++


My name is Andreas and I am a Danish software engineer. I currently work as a Platform engineer at [ZeroNorth](https://zeronorth.com/).

My educational background is in baking and I graduated in 2024 from an undergraduate degree in software development from [IT University of Copenhagen](https://en.itu.dk/). 

During my studies I've worked as a software engineering student assistant in [Motorola Solutions](https://www.motorolasolutions.com/en_us.html) and in [A.P. Moeller - Maersk](https://www.maersk.com/). This has enabled me to work early in my career in a DevOps and later a Platform Engineering team.

## Professional interests

Right now I'm mainly interested in **cloud computing/infrastructure** and creating **containerized workloads**.

I like to work with the following technologies:

- Containers
- Kubernetes
- Terraform
- Workflows/Pipelines

### Programming languages

When the opportunity shows I enjoy writing solutions in functional programming languages such as F# and Elixir.

For the remainder of the time I enjoy writing Golang. I've taken a hobby interest in Zig, Rust and Gleam.
