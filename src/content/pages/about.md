# December 2022

My name is Andreas. I'm located in **Copenhagen, Denmark**.

I'm currently studying a [bachelors degree in software development @ ITU](https://en.itu.dk/Programmes/BSc-Programmes/Software-Development). I am expecting to graduate at end-of-year 2023.

Since May 2021, I have been working in a DevOps department at **Motorola Solutions**.

I'm professionally interested in DevOps, backend development and cloud technology. I'm basically interested in working *behind the scenes*, doing things that customers don't see, but will feel when their systems are working.

I'm personally interested in [motorsport](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcCBrelNGfpchXKLFt8gtKg), [working on my own software projects](https://github.com/andreaswachs), working out and cooking.
